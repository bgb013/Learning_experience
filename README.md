This project it to showcase some of the work done on my Marketing Analytics Bootcamp.

The first project we work on takes us into a hypothetical scenario in which we have to provide a sofa company Chillomania our findings on their ideal online direct marketing components, their customer journey map and their MarTech stack.

The purpose of this is to improve their online strategy as well as to recommend the different tools and actions that would be necessary for their online success.
